: Effective leaders come in all shapes and sizes, but a common characteristic is a high degree of what psychologists call emotional intelligence. Truly great leaders are self aware and know how to use their emotions and those of others as a source of information to help navigate through life more effectively. An abundance of research indicates that emotional intelligence is more important than technical skills or traditional cognitive skills in shaping leadership effectiveness. Mounting evidence also suggests that an organization?s success is directly related to the emotional intelligence level of its leaders. 

As the working environment continues to change, emotional intelligence skills will become increasing important in determining who succeeds and who fails. This course will help participants develop the emotional intelligence competencies required by a position of leadership. Participants will assess, develop and apply their own emotional intelligence and will learn how to cultivate emotional intelligence in their organization."
